## [2.2.0] - 2025-11-23

### 🎉 New Feature: Spec-Workflow-Orchestrator Skill

This release introduces a complete **Planning Orchestration System** alongside the existing research capabilities, transforming the project into a dual-skill orchestration platform.

---

### ✨ Added

#### New Skill: spec-workflow-orchestrator

A comprehensive planning workflow that takes projects from ideation to development-ready specifications.

**Workflow Phases:**
1. **spec-analyst** - Requirements gathering and user story creation
2. **spec-architect** - System design, component architecture, and ADRs
3. **spec-planner** - Task breakdown with dependencies and implementation order

**Key Features:**
- **Quality Gates**: 85% threshold with up to 3 iteration attempts per agent
- **Per-Project Structure**: Each project gets its own `docs/projects/{slug}/` directory
- **Interactive Decision System**: Detects existing projects and offers New/Refine/Archive options
- **Archive System**: Timestamped backups with integrity verification and rollback
- **State Management**: JSON-based workflow state persistence across sessions
- **Version Detection**: Automatic next version detection (v2, v3...v99)

**New Agents (3):**
- `.claude/agents/spec-analyst.md` - Requirements elicitation specialist
- `.claude/agents/spec-architect.md` - System design and ADR creation
- `.claude/agents/spec-planner.md` - Task breakdown and dependency mapping

**New Utilities (5 scripts, 420+ lines):**
- `.claude/utils/archive_project.sh` - Create timestamped project archives
- `.claude/utils/restore_archive.sh` - Restore from specific archive timestamp
- `.claude/utils/list_archives.sh` - List all archives for a project
- `.claude/utils/workflow_state.sh` - JSON state management (set/get/show/clear)
- `.claude/utils/detect_next_version.sh` - Find next available version number

#### Universal Skill Activation Hook

**File:** `.claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit.py`

Intercepts ALL user prompts and enforces proper skill activation:
- Detects 37+ research trigger keywords → enforces multi-agent-researcher
- Detects 90+ planning trigger keywords → enforces spec-workflow-orchestrator
- Regex pattern matching for intent detection
- Priority-based enforcement (research=critical, planning=high)

#### Skill Rules Configuration

**File:** `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json`

Centralized trigger configuration:
- `promptTriggers.keywords` - Word-level detection
- `promptTriggers.intentPatterns` - Regex patterns for contextual matching
- `fileTriggers.pathPatterns` - File-based skill activation
- `validation.qualityGates` - Per-skill quality thresholds

#### New Slash Commands (4)

- `/plan-feature` - Invoke spec-workflow-orchestrator for feature planning
- `/project-status` - Show current project implementation status
- `/research-topic` - Invoke multi-agent-researcher for topic research
- `/verify-structure` - Verify project structure alignment

#### Documentation

- `PRODUCTION_READY_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive implementation status
- `HONEST_REVIEW.md` - Candid assessment of system capabilities
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Canonical file organization reference
- `.claude/STRUCTURE_ALIGNMENT.md` - Official vs custom file documentation

#### Test Suites (2)

- `tests/test_interactive_decision.sh` - 8 tests for interactive decision feature
- `tests/test_production_implementation.sh` - 10 tests covering all production features

---

### 🔧 Changed

#### multi-agent-researcher Skill

- **Refactored to Option B Architecture**: Skill orchestrator in dedicated directory
- **Added Reference Documentation**: `reference.md` with implementation details
- **Added Examples**: `examples.md` with comprehensive usage patterns
- **Moved Agents**: Agents now in `.claude/agents/` for proper discovery

#### CLAUDE.md Instructions

- Added comprehensive planning orchestration rules
- Added synthesis phase enforcement (Write tool restriction)
- Added custom configuration file documentation
- Clarified official vs custom Claude Code files

#### .gitignore

- Added `docs/projects/*`, `docs/examples/*`, `docs/testing/*` (user outputs)
- Added `docs/plans/*`, `docs/analysis/*`, `docs/adrs/*` (user-generated)
- Added `.claude/utils/logs/` (runtime logs)
- Preserved directory structure via `.gitkeep` files

### 🔮 Planned (Not Implemented)

**Compound Request Detection** - Smart handling when user triggers BOTH skills:
- Signal strength analysis (action vs subject detection)
- TRUE/FALSE compound pattern matching
- User clarification via AskUserQuestion
- Implementation plan saved to `docs/plans/compound-detection-implementation-plan.md`

---

### 🐛 Fixed

- Agent discovery issue (moved from `skills/*/agents/` to `.claude/agents/`)
- Frontmatter formatting in spec-analyst.md
- Missing planning keywords in skill-rules.json
- User-generated files incorrectly committed to git

---

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

None. This release is additive - existing multi-agent-researcher functionality remains unchanged.

---

### 📋 Migration Guide

**From v2.1.x:**
1. Pull latest changes
2. No configuration changes required
3. New skills auto-activate based on prompt keywords
4. Use `/plan-feature` or `/research-topic` for explicit invocation
