## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** installed ([Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise tier](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills))<sup>[[1]](#ref-1)</sup>
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedibrahim085/Claude-Multi-Agent-Research-System-Skill.git
cd Claude-Multi-Agent-Research-System-Skill
```

2. **Start Claude Code** in the project directory:
```bash
claude
```

The SessionStart hook will automatically:
- Create required directories (`files/research_notes/`, `files/reports/`, `logs/`)
- Initialize session logging
- Display setup status

**Note**: Hooks are pre-configured in `.claude/settings.json` and work out-of-the-box. **Do not duplicate hooks in `settings.local.json`** to avoid duplicate hook executions.

### Your First Research Query

Try this example:
```
research quantum computing fundamentals
```

**Expected output**:
```
📝 Session logs initialized: logs/session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_{transcript.txt,tool_calls.jsonl}

# Research Complete: Quantum Computing Fundamentals

Comprehensive research completed with 3 specialized researchers.

## Key Findings
1. [Finding from researcher 1]
2. [Finding from researcher 2]
3. [Finding from researcher 3]

## Files Generated
**Research Notes**: `files/research_notes/`
- quantum-computing-fundamentals-basics_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md
- quantum-computing-fundamentals-hardware_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md
- quantum-computing-fundamentals-algorithms_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md

**Final Report**: `files/reports/quantum-computing-fundamentals_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`
```

## Why This Approach?

### vs. Direct Tools (WebSearch/WebFetch)

**Direct approach**:
```
User: "Tell me about quantum computing"
→ Claude does 1-2 WebSearch calls
→ Returns summary from top results
→ Limited depth, single perspective
```

**This orchestrated approach**:
```
User: "Research quantum computing"
→ Decomposes into 3-4 subtopics (basics, hardware, algorithms, applications)
→ Spawns 3-4 researcher agents in parallel
→ Each agent conducts focused, multi-source research
→ Report-writer synthesizes comprehensive findings
→ Cross-referenced, authoritative sources
```

**When direct tools are sufficient**: Single factual questions ("What is X?"), quick documentation lookups, specific URL fetches.

### vs. MCP Servers

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**<sup>[[2]](#ref-2)</sup> is Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI systems to data sources through servers.

**MCP Approach** (agent as MCP server):
- Each agent is an **MCP server** providing tools
- Claude Code calls MCP tools to interact with agents
- ❌ **No enforced workflow** - Claude can skip decomposition or synthesis
- ❌ **No architectural constraints** - relies entirely on prompts
- ❌ **Agents don't coordinate** - just isolated tool calls
- ❌ **No guaranteed synthesis phase**

**This Orchestrated Approach**:
- Agents are **Task subprocesses**<sup>[[3]](#ref-3)</sup> with defined roles (researcher, report-writer)
- Orchestrator **enforces workflow phases** via `allowed-tools` constraint<sup>[[4]](#ref-4)</sup>
- ✅ **Architectural enforcement** (~95% reliability)
- ✅ **Parallel execution** - spawn all researchers simultaneously
- ✅ **Mandatory synthesis** - orchestrator physically cannot write reports (lacks Write tool)
- ✅ **Quality gates** - verify all phases complete before delivery

**Example**:
```
MCP Approach:
User: "research quantum computing"
→ Claude calls researcher-mcp-tool (maybe)
→ Claude writes synthesis itself (no delegation enforcement)
→ May skip decomposition or parallel execution
→ Workflow depends on prompt compliance

This Approach:
User: "research quantum computing"
→ Orchestrator MUST decompose (Phase 1)
→ Orchestrator MUST spawn researchers in parallel (Phase 2)
→ Orchestrator CANNOT write synthesis - lacks Write tool (architectural constraint)
→ Orchestrator MUST delegate to report-writer agent (Phase 3)
→ Workflow enforced by architecture, not prompts
```

### vs. Sequential Research

**Sequential Approach** (original SDK pattern<sup>[[5]](#ref-5)</sup>):
- Research subtopics one-by-one
- Total time: N × (research time per subtopic)
- Example: 3 subtopics × 10 min each = **30 minutes**

**Parallel Orchestration** (this project):
- Research all subtopics simultaneously (Claude Code supports up to 10 parallel tasks<sup>[[6]](#ref-6)</sup>)
- Total time: max(research times) + synthesis time
- Example: max(10, 12, 8 min) + 3 min = **15 minutes**
- **~30-50% faster** for typical 3-4 subtopic research<sup>[[7]](#ref-7)</sup>

**Additional benefits**:
- **Reliability**: If one researcher fails, others complete; orchestrator can retry failed subtopics
- **Isolation**: Independent researchers can't block each other
- **Scalability**: Performance scales with subtopic count

### Architectural Benefits

#### 1. Reliability Through Constraints

```yaml
# From SKILL.md frontmatter:
allowed-tools: Task, Read, Glob, TodoWrite
# Note: Write is deliberately excluded
```

- Orchestrator **physically cannot** bypass report-writer agent
- Prompts can be ignored; architecture cannot
- ~95% enforcement reliability (vs. ~20-50% for prompt-based approaches)<sup>[[4]](#ref-4)</sup>

#### 2. Audit Trail & Compliance

Every tool call is logged to:
- `transcript.txt` - human-readable session log
- `tool_calls.jsonl` - structured JSON for analysis

**Enables**:
- Verify workflow compliance after-the-fact
- Debug agent behavior
- Compliance requirements (audit who did what, when)

#### 3. Quality Gates

Before synthesis:
- ✅ Verify all research notes exist
- ✅ Detect violations (e.g., orchestrator writing reports)
- ✅ Fail-fast on incomplete research

#### 4. Scalability

- Parallel execution scales with subtopic count
- Independent researchers reduce single points of failure
- Synthesis happens once after all research completes

### When NOT to Use

This architecture is **overkill** for:

- ❌ Single factual questions ("What is the capital of France?")
- ❌ Quick lookups ("Latest version of Python?")
- ❌ Code-related tasks ("Debug this function", "Write a script")
- ❌ Decision evaluation ("Should I use React or Vue?")

**Use direct tools** (WebSearch, WebFetch) for these instead.

**Use this architecture when**:

- ✅ Multi-source research needed (2+ authoritative sources)
- ✅ Synthesis across perspectives required
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage important
- ✅ Audit trail needed for compliance
- ✅ Quality gates required

---

## How It Works

The orchestrated multi-agent workflow has four enforced phases:

### Phase 1: Decomposition

**Orchestrator**:
1. Analyzes user's research question
2. Breaks topic into 2-4 focused subtopics that are:
   - Mutually exclusive (minimal overlap)
   - Collectively exhaustive (cover whole topic)
   - Independently researchable

**Example**:
```
Query: "Research quantum computing"
→ Subtopics:
  1. Theoretical foundations (qubits, superposition, entanglement)
  2. Hardware implementations (superconducting, ion trap, topological)
  3. Algorithms & applications (Shor's, Grover's, VQE, QAOA)
```

### Phase 2: Parallel Research

**Orchestrator spawns all researchers simultaneously**:

```python
# Conceptual (actual implementation uses Task tool)
spawn_parallel([
    researcher(topic="Theoretical foundations", context="quantum computing"),
    researcher(topic="Hardware implementations", context="quantum computing"),
    researcher(topic="Algorithms & applications", context="quantum computing")
])
```

Each researcher:
- Conducts web research (WebSearch tool)
- Gathers authoritative sources
- Extracts key findings
- Saves results to `files/research_notes/{subtopic-slug}.md`

**Parallelism**: Claude Code supports up to 10 concurrent tasks<sup>[[6]](#ref-6)</sup>; excess tasks are queued.

### Phase 3: Synthesis

**⚠️ Architectural Enforcement Active**

The orchestrator **does not have Write tool access** (see `allowed-tools` in SKILL.md). This architectural constraint **physically prevents** the orchestrator from writing synthesis reports.

**Enforced workflow**:
1. Orchestrator verifies all research notes exist (Glob tool)
2. Orchestrator **MUST** spawn report-writer agent (Task tool)
3. Report-writer reads ALL research notes (Read tool)
4. Report-writer synthesizes findings into comprehensive report
5. Report-writer writes to `files/reports/{topic}_{timestamp}.md` (Write tool)

**Cannot be bypassed**: Attempting to write reports from orchestrator results in tool permission error.

### Phase 4: Delivery

Orchestrator:
1. Reads final report
2. Creates user-facing summary with:
   - Key findings (3-5 bullet points)
   - Research scope (subtopics investigated)
   - File paths (research notes + final report)
3. Delivers to user

- **Advanced Only**: Don't edit unless you understand hook system deeply
- **Caution**: Edit carefully; incorrect changes can break functionality
- **Auto-Generated**: Created/updated by system; don't edit manually
- **Optional**: Only create if you need user-specific overrides

### Default Paths

Configured in `.claude/config.json`:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "research_notes": "files/research_notes",
    "reports": "files/reports",
    "logs": "logs",
    "state": ".claude/state"
  },
  "logging": {
    "enabled": true,
    "format": "flat",
    "log_tool_calls": true
  },
  "research": {
    "max_parallel_researchers": 4,
    "require_synthesis_delegation": true,
    "quality_gates_enabled": true
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

Override paths without editing config:

```bash
export RESEARCH_NOTES_DIR=/custom/path/notes
export REPORTS_DIR=/custom/path/reports
export LOGS_DIR=/custom/path/logs
```

Then restart Claude Code.

### Advanced Setup

For custom configuration:

```bash
python3 setup.py           # Interactive setup with prompts
python3 setup.py --verify  # Check setup without changes
python3 setup.py --repair  # Auto-fix issues
```

The setup script allows you to:
- Customize directory paths
- Configure max parallel researchers (1-10)
- Verify Python version and hooks
- Check for missing files or directories

**⚠️ Important**: If you create `settings.local.json`, **remove the `hooks` section** from it. Hooks are already configured in `settings.json` and duplicating them will cause duplicate hook executions.

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Comparison to Reference SDK

This project adapts the multi-agent research pattern from [Anthropic's research-agent demo](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-demos/tree/main/research-agent)<sup>[[5]](#ref-5)</sup> for Claude Code's skill system.

| Feature | Reference (Python SDK) | This Project (Claude Code) |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Platform** | Python Agent SDK (standalone) | **Claude Code Skill** (integrated) |
| **Hooks** | Python SDK hooks (`HookMatcher`) | Shell-based hooks (Python scripts) |
| **Enforcement** | Behavioral (via prompts) | **Architectural** (via `allowed-tools` ~95% reliability)<sup>[[4]](#ref-4)</sup> |
| **Logging** | SDK-managed with `parent_tool_use_id` | **Custom hooks with heuristic agent detection** |
| **Agent Identification** | SDK's `parent_tool_use_id` field | **File path + tool usage heuristics** |
| **Configuration** | Python code | **JSON config + environment variables** |
| **Deployment** | Standalone Python app | **Claude Code skill + hooks** |
| **Session Logs** | Nested directories | **Flat structure** (configurable) |
| **Setup** | Manual installation | **Automatic first-time setup** |

**Use Reference Implementation If**:
- Building standalone Python application
- Need SDK's native hook system
- Want official Anthropic patterns without modification

**Use This Implementation If**:
- Using Claude Code as primary environment
- Need workflow enforcement via architecture
- Require audit logging for compliance
- Want configuration flexibility (JSON + env vars)

### Enforcement Mechanisms

#### 1. `allowed-tools` Constraint

From `.claude/skills/multi-agent-researcher/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: multi-agent-researcher
allowed-tools: Task, Read, Glob, TodoWrite
---
```

When this skill is active, Claude can **only** use the listed tools<sup>[[4]](#ref-4)</sup>. The Write tool is deliberately excluded, making it **architecturally impossible** for the orchestrator to write synthesis reports.

**Reliability**: ~95% (cannot be bypassed through prompt injection).

#### 2. Quality Gates

Implemented in hooks (`post-tool-use-track-research.py`):

```python
# Pseudo-code representation
if synthesis_phase and tool == "Write" and agent == "orchestrator":
    violation = "Orchestrator attempted to write synthesis report"
    log_violation(violation)
    # Report-writer agent should have been used
```

#### 3. Session State Tracking

Tracks workflow progression:
- Decomposition complete?
- All researchers spawned?
- All research notes exist?
- Report-writer spawned?
- Synthesis complete?

Stored in `.claude/state/research-workflow-state.json`.

### Hooks Architecture

The hook system is the **foundation of enforcement and tracking**. Without hooks, this system wouldn't work—`allowed-tools` constraints prevent unauthorized actions, but hooks provide logging, quality gates, and session management.

#### How Hooks Work

Claude Code fires hooks at specific lifecycle events:
- **PostToolUse**: After every tool call (Read, Write, Task, WebSearch, etc.)
- **SessionStart**: When Claude Code session begins

Our hooks are registered in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/post-tool-use-track-research.py\""
      }]
    }],
    "SessionStart": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/session-start.py\""
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

#### PostToolUse Hook (`post-tool-use-track-research.py`)

**Runs after EVERY tool call** to provide comprehensive tracking and enforcement.

**Responsibilities**:

1. **Agent Identification**
   ```python
   # Heuristics to identify which agent made the call
   if tool == "Task" and "subagent_type" in input:
       agent = "orchestrator"
   elif file_path.startswith("files/research_notes/"):
       agent = "researcher"
   elif file_path.startswith("files/reports/"):
       agent = "report-writer"
   ```

2. **Logging**
   - Appends to `transcript.txt` with human-readable format
   - Appends to `tool_calls.jsonl` with structured JSON
   - Includes: timestamp, agent, tool, input, output, duration

3. **Quality Gate Enforcement**
   ```python
   # Detect workflow violations
   if synthesis_phase and tool == "Write" and agent == "orchestrator":
       violation = "Orchestrator attempted synthesis (should use report-writer)"
       log_violation(violation)
   ```

4. **Phase Tracking**
   - Updates `.claude/state/research-workflow-state.json`
   - Tracks: decomposition → research → synthesis → delivery
   - Records outputs (research note paths, report path)

**Example log entry**:
```
[10:57:22] ORCHESTRATOR → Task ✅
  Input: {"subagent_type": "researcher", "description": "Research quantum computing"}
  Output: Success (2.4 KB)
  Duration: 1250ms
```

#### SessionStart Hook (`session-start.py`)

**Runs once when Claude Code session begins**.

**Responsibilities**:

1. **Auto-Setup**
   ```python
   # Create directories if missing
   create_directory("files/research_notes/")
   create_directory("files/reports/")
   create_directory("logs/")
   create_directory(".claude/state/")
   ```

2. **Session Initialization**
   - Generates unique session ID (e.g., `session_20251118_105714`)
   - Creates new log files (`transcript.txt`, `tool_calls.jsonl`)
   - Displays setup status to user

3. **Session Restoration** (if previous session was interrupted)
   - Reads `.claude/state/research-workflow-state.json`
   - Checks if research was incomplete
   - Offers to resume or start fresh

**Example output**:
```
📝 Session logs initialized: logs/session_20251118_105714_{transcript.txt,tool_calls.jsonl}
✅ All directories exist
✅ Hooks configured correctly
```

#### Hook + Constraint Synergy

The **combination** of hooks and `allowed-tools` creates robust enforcement:

| Component | Role | Reliability |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `allowed-tools: Task, Read, Glob, TodoWrite` | **Prevents** orchestrator from writing reports | ~95% (architectural) |
| PostToolUse quality gates | **Detects** if violation somehow occurs | ~100% (catches everything) |
| Session state tracking | **Verifies** all workflow phases complete | ~100% (checks existence) |

**Together**: ~99%+ enforcement reliability with full audit trail.

#### Hook Execution Flow

```
User: "research quantum computing"
    ↓
SessionStart hook fires
    → Creates directories
    → Initializes session logs
    → Displays status
    ↓
Orchestrator decomposes query
    ↓
Orchestrator spawns researchers (Task tool)
    ↓ PostToolUse hook fires
        → Identifies agent: orchestrator
        → Logs: Task call
        → Updates phase: research (in progress)
    ↓
Each researcher conducts research (WebSearch, Write tools)
    ↓ PostToolUse hook fires (multiple times)
        → Identifies agent: researcher (via file path heuristic)
        → Logs: WebSearch + Write calls
        → Tracks: research note paths
    ↓
All researchers complete
    ↓
Orchestrator spawns report-writer (Task tool)
    ↓ PostToolUse hook fires
        → Identifies agent: orchestrator
        → Logs: Task call
        → Updates phase: synthesis (in progress)
    ↓
Report-writer synthesizes (Read, Write tools)
    ↓ PostToolUse hook fires (multiple times)
        → Identifies agent: report-writer (via file path heuristic)
        → Logs: Read + Write calls
        → Updates phase: synthesis (complete)
    ↓
Session ends
    ↓
All tool calls logged ✅
All phases tracked ✅
Audit trail complete ✅
```

**Without hooks**: `allowed-tools` would prevent violations, but you'd have no logs, no tracking, no session management, no quality gate verification.

**With hooks**: Complete observability + enforcement + automation.

### Session Logging

#### Log Format: Flat Structure

```
logs/
├── session_20251118_105714_transcript.txt       # Human-readable
└── session_20251118_105714_tool_calls.jsonl    # Structured JSON
```

**Benefits of flat structure**:
- Easier navigation (no nested directories)
- Simpler programmatic analysis (`grep`, `jq`)
- Compatible with log aggregation tools

#### transcript.txt Example

```
Research Agent Session Log
Session ID: session_20251118_105714
Started: 2025-11-18T10:57:14.369265
================================================================================

[10:57:22] ORCHESTRATOR → Task ✅
  Input: {"subagent_type": "researcher", "description": "Research theoretical foundations", ...}
  Output: Success (2.4 KB)
  Duration: 1250ms

[10:58:45] RESEARCHER → WebSearch ✅
  Input: {"query": "quantum computing qubits superposition"}
  Output: Found 10 results
  Duration: 850ms

[11:02:10] ORCHESTRATOR → Task ✅
  Input: {"subagent_type": "report-writer", ...}
  Output: Success (15.2 KB)
  Duration: 3400ms
```

#### Agent Identification Heuristics

Since Claude Code doesn't provide `parent_tool_use_id` (SDK feature), agents are identified via:

1. **File paths**: Writing to `files/research_notes/` → researcher; `files/reports/` → report-writer
2. **Tool usage**: Task tool with `subagent_type` → orchestrator
3. **Session phase**: During synthesis + WebSearch → researcher

**Accuracy**: ~90% (trade-off for not requiring SDK).
