# Test Suite: Deliverable Structure Validation
# Layer 2 (Behavior) - Validates skill output files have required sections
#
# Purpose: After skill execution, verify output files have expected structure
# This is automatable because section headers are deterministic.
#
# NOTE: This test should be run AFTER a skill execution to validate outputs.
#       If no outputs exist, tests will be skipped (not failed).
#
# Run: ./tests/spec-workflow/test_deliverable_structure.sh [project-slug]
